A tool to fix Notion's problematic HTML exports for reliable Windows operation. Renames UUID-filled filenames, updates HTML links, and organizes exports with proper naming conventions.

**Why this exists:** Notion's HTML exports generate long UUID-containing filenames that often break Windows file system limits, making exports causing unexpected problem

## What does it do âœ¨

- Removes UUIDs from filenames while preserving extensions
- Handles naming conflicts automatically (appends _1, _2, etc.)
- Updates all HTML internal links to match cleaned filenames
- Renames export folder with workspace name + date
